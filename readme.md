### Requirements
To run the app Python version 3.12 is needed. Also packages dash version "2.18.2", plotly version "5.24.1" and pandas version "2.2". If you use poetry i included .toml file containing the versions of packages and python. You can simply run command poetry install and everythin should download. If for some reason this does not work or you dont use poetry environment I will list command for installing the packages via pip:
* pip install pandas==2.2.0
* pip install plotly==5.24.1
* pip install dash==2.18.2

This should be everything you need to run the jupyter notebooks.
